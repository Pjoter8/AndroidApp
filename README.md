# Language App
The application is designed for the teacher to convey knowledge to students. The teacher has their own profile where they create a unique class name and then add specific vocabulary words there. The list can be edited by removing individual words or completely deleting a class - this happens when all the words are removed.

The student can log in to their interface using the teacher's username and the class name provided by the teacher. When logged in, they have the option to take a vocabulary quiz created by the teacher. They can check their score at the end of the quiz. If they are satisfied with their score, they can end the quiz, and if not, they can retake it
# If necessary
If the Firebase database doesn't connect automatically, you will need to add it manually. Below is a link with a tutorial excerpt on how to do it precisely. It is explained from 1:20 to 2:15<br>
